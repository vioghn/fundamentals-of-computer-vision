## HW1
* This assignment focuses on key photographic concepts such as shutter, lens, focal length, and image types. It also includes tasks like calculating histograms, implementing histogram stretching, and performing histogram matching in practice.

## HW2
* This exercise covers practical applications and theoretical concepts in image processing. Topics include the Sobel operator, gradient direction measurement, Gaussian filtering, noise removal, and Canny edge detection. Theoretical aspects such as low-pass and high-pass filtering, types of noise (additive, multiplicative, and salt-and-pepper), and Fourier transform calculations are also explored.

## HW3
* This assignment delves into color spaces, comparing and converting between RGB, CMYK, HSV, and YCbCr. It includes practical tasks like displaying images in separate color channels, creating panoramas, and using facial landmarks with the dlib library to apply masks. Additional implementations involve scanning photos as in Camscanner (grayscale conversion, noise reduction, edge detection, image boundary detection, and background removal), Harris corner detection, and exploring keypoint extraction methods like ORB, SURF, and SIFT.

## HW4
* This homework emphasizes theoretical and practical applications of image morphology. It discusses Otsuâ€™s algorithm, segmentation using structural elements, and operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and the hit-or-miss operator. Practical tasks include implementing basic morphological operators, extracting image skeletons, and detecting edges.

## HW5
* This exercise introduces concepts like Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and shape descriptors, alongside foundational topics in deep learning, such as activation functions and CNN-based feature extraction. Practical tasks include training a simple neural network for image classification on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras, employing both sequential and functional approaches.

## HW6
* This assignment explores advanced topics in computer vision and deep learning. The theoretical portion includes core concepts in CNNs, gradient issues, and parameter calculations. Practical tasks involve training convolutional networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset, applying data augmentation, comparing results with transfer learning using ResNet50, and implementing semantic segmentation with advanced Keras features.
